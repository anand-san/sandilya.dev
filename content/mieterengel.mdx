Through the use of digital-automated processes, transparent communication and the experience of partner lawyers tenants can use MieterEngel's service to solve conveniently from the couch current and future problems with neighbors or landlords.

MieterEngel helps tenants solve rental problems online. Members gets access to the MieterEngel portal where they can directly connect with their personal lawyer and ask questions to any rental problem.

The consultation flow starts with the customer submitting a question in the customer portal. The customer is required to type a message and often the lawyer needs some case related documents as well e.g. rental contract, utility bill, termination letter. The customer can either upload existing files/images or take photos of documents with the camera function in the web app and upload them that way.

The service team reviews the request and if some important documents are missing, the customer is asked to upload these before the message is forwarded to the lawyer.
