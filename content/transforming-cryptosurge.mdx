## Enhancing CryptoSurge: A Discord Bot Success Story

**[Adarsh](https://twitter.com/davinciDXB)**, a seasoned crypto trader and COO at [CryptoXpress](https://cryptoxpress.com/) ([@crypto_express](https://twitter.com/crypto_xpress)),
faced challenges in automating processes within his trading group, CryptoSurge.
Which I was also a part of. He wanted to streamline communication and enhance accessibility to crucial information to his community members.
Understanding the problems, I proposed to develop a series of Discord bots tailored to the needs of his community.

### In short, I needed to solve the following problems using Discord bots

- Automate the process of sharing live holdings from multiple exchanges on demand
- Provide real-time Aadarsh's order information
- Provide real-time market information on demand
- Share knowledge and enhance communication within the community and the new members of the community
- Introduce engaging elements to the community

### How I did it?

#### Lets start with automating the process of sharing live holdings from multiple exchanges on demand

To address the need for consolidated and accessible trading information, I developed a Discord bot capable of aggregating holdings from multiple exchanges,

I was able to arrange the data from differnet exchanges where there were assets present using the exchange APIs. We wanted to present this information whenever
a user sends a command in the chat `!portfolio` in this case. The cummunity was huge so we had to make sure that the bot responds to the command as fast as possible and also
that it do not spams the exchanges API as in that case we would either hit the rate limit or get banned from using the API.

I solved this by storing the latest data in a cache and creating a webhook that updates the cache whenever the portfolio changes.
This helped the bot deliver the latest data to the users in a matter of milliseconds.
Instead of presenting raw numbers, the bot utilized percentages to provide a clearer understanding of portfolio composition.

This feature enabled CryptoSurge members to make informed trading decisions based on Adarsh's portfolio

#### Providing real-time Aadarsh's order information

Thats it so far lads

Introducing Cexy, a sophisticated crypto price ticker app designed for Discord. Cexy not only displays real-time market prices but also offers comprehensive details such as price changes over 24 hours and 7 days, trade volume, and dominance percentages. This bot empowers CryptoSurge members with up-to-date information crucial for making informed trading decisions.

## 3. Personal Twitter Feed App

Enhancing communication within the community, we developed an app that automatically relays messages to the Discord channel whenever Adarsh posts on Twitter. This feature ensures that CryptoSurge members stay well-informed about the latest developments and insights directly from Adarsh.

## 4. Crypto Twitter News

Keeping pace with the fast-paced world of crypto, our team built a bot capable of subscribing to multiple Twitter profiles. This bot notifies the Discord channel promptly whenever there is a new tweet from the subscribed accounts, ensuring that CryptoSurge members are always in the loop on relevant industry updates.

## 5. Discord DM Bot

Acknowledging the importance of onboarding, we implemented a Discord Direct Message (DM) bot that automatically sends private messages to new members. These messages contain essential information about server rules and guidelines, facilitating a smooth integration into the CryptoSurge community.

## 6. Logo Quiz Bot

Recognizing the need for entertainment alongside market analysis, we introduced a Logo Quiz Crypto app. This engaging feature presents users with crypto token logos, challenging them to identify the corresponding tokens. Participants earn points for correct guesses, fostering a lively and interactive environment within the community.

## Conclusion

The implementation of these Discord bots not only addressed Adarsh's specific needs but also significantly enhanced the overall trading experience within CryptoSurge. By fostering efficient communication, providing real-time market insights, and introducing engaging elements, our tailored solutions have contributed to the growth and cohesion of this vibrant crypto community. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, these bots stand as a testament to the power of innovation in streamlining and enhancing digital collaboration within trading groups.
