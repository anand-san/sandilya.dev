This is an example post, with a [link](https://nextjs.org) and a React component:

{/* <TestComponent name='next-mdx-remote' /> */}

The title and description are pulled from the MDX file and processed using `gray-matter`. Additionally, links are rendered using a custom component passed to `next-mdx-remote`.
